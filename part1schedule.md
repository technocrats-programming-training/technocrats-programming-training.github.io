# Part 1: Java Programming Basics
Most meetings have  two dates/times listed, but they are exactly the same so you should only come to one. 

Weekly Meeting 1: Monday 6-7pm OR Tuesday 1-2pm

Weekly Meeting 2: Friday 1-2pm OR Friday 7-8pm

Some meetings only have one time option due to scheduling constraints. This is indicated in the table below, and  a reminder will be sent out before each of those meetings
