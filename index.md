# Technocrats Programming Training
This summer, FRC Team 2239 The Technocrats from Hopkins High School will be hosting virtual programming training. Mentors and students on other FRC teams, as well as prospective members at Hopkins High Schoool are welcome to join. 

Training will be split into two parts. The first part can be skipped by those with Java programming knowledge.
### Time Commitment
Meeting times will be decided based on the availability of everyone intereste, and each week will include 2 hours of synchronous meetings and another 2-3 hours of asynchronous work.
## Part 1: Java Programming Basics
Dates: Week of June 20 to Week of July 11

This section is an introduction to the Java programming language. We will primarily be following the Codecademy Java tutorial, with some supplemental projects, an introduction to using IDEs, and an introduction to Git/GitHub.

Note that this section could also be done individually if you would like to work at your own rate or you can't make it to some/all of the meetings. The meetings will mostly be discussions of the Codecademy content, and offer accountability and an opportunity to ask questions. We hope that by providing additional structure, participants will have more motivation to actually complete the Codecademy course.

## Part 2: FRC Programming Basics
Dates: Week of July 18-Week of August 23

This section will be an introduction to FRC programming in Java. By the end of the section, participants will be able to program FRC robots with differential drivetrains, motors, and solenoids to execute teleoperated open loop tasks, and efficiently debug their programs. Possible additional topics include PID loops, logging, and unit testing for robot programs.

Throughout the section, participants will use [Romis](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html) to test their code. These are an inexpensive alternative to FRC robots that can run the same code. This training course will place an emphasis on projects, debugging, and hands on learning. Each Romi costs $200. Members of other FRC teams (not team 2239) will need to provide their own Romis, but Hopkins High School students will most likely be provided one by the team that they can use for the duration of the course, possibly shared with another student.
