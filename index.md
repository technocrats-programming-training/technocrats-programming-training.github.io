# Technocrats Programming Training
This summer, FRC Team 2239 The Technocrats will be hosting virtual programming training. Mentors and students on other FRC teams, as well as prospective members are welcome to join. 

Training will be split into two parts. The first part can be skipped by those with Java programming knowledge.
## Part 1: Java Programming Basics
Dates: Week of June 20 to Week of July 11

This section is an introduction to the Java programming language. We will primarily be following the Codecademy Java tutorial, with some supplemental projects and an introduction to Git/GitHub.

Note that this section could also be done individually if you would like to work at your own rate or you can't make it to some/all of the meetings. The meetings will mostly be discussions of the Codecademy content, and offer accountability and an opportunity to ask questions.
* [Week 1: Hello World, Variables](part1lessons/week1HelloWorldVariables.md)
* [Week 2: Object Oriented Java]()
* [Week 3: Conditionals and Control Flow, Arrays and Array Lists, Loops]()
* [Week 4: Advanced Object Oriented Programming]()
## Part 2: FRC Programming Basics
Dates: Week of July 18-Week of August 23

This section will be an introduction to FRC programming in Java. By the end of the section, participants will be able to program FRC robots with differential drivetrains, motors, and solenoids to execute teleoperated open loop tasks, and efficiently debug their programs. Possible additional topics include PID loops, logging, and unit testing for robot programs.

Throughout the section, participants will use [Romis](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html) to test their code. These are an inexpensive alternative to FRC robots that can run the same code. This training course will place an emphasis on projects, debugging, and hands on learning.
