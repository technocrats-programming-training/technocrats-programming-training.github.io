# 2.2: Command Based Robot Programming
## Readings
Read the following pages from the WPILib Documentation. The WPILib Documentation does a fairly good job of explaining Command Based programming, but has some advanced, technical details that you do not need to know. As you read, make a quick note of anything that you do not understand so I can either explain it or confirm that you do not need to know about it at the meeting.
* [What is "Command-Based" Programming?](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html#)
* [Subsystems](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/subsystems.html)
* [Commands](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html)
