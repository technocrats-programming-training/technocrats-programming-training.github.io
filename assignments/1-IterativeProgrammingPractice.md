# Assignment 1: Iterative Programming Practice
In this assignment, you will write a very simple iterative robot program that prints diagnostic messages to the console.
## Requirements
* When the robot turns on, print `"Robot Has Initialized"` to the console
* Every cycle of the robot's loop (every time `teleopPeriodic()`) is called, print the number of times `teleopPeriodic()` has been called to the console. For example, the first time you call `teleopPeriodic()`, it should print `"1"`, the second time it should print `"2"`, etc.
