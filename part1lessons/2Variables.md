## Meeting Agenda
* Ask questions from Codecademy
* Answer survey questions about variables
    * Discuss answers
* Divide into groups to work on assignment

## Assignment
* Add yourself to the assignment using the Variables link in schedule table
* Do not change the java code already inside the  `main()` method, or worry about how it works.
    * This program is written to pull arguments from the command line into variables. This will allow you to test your code. For example, running `java Main.java Henry Scheible 17` will set the variables `firstName` to `"Henry"`, `lastName` to `"Scheible"`, and `age` to `17`.
* Add code to accomplish each of the tasks that are explained in comments inside the file. Note that you do not need to solve each of these tasks with one statement, use as many as you want. (They all can be solved with one statement though, so try that if you are interested in finding the optimal solution).
* Navigate to the version control tab, name your commit, and click the Commit and Push button to send your changes to GitHub.
