## Assignment
* Accept the GitHub classroom assignment [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/8RnDyAR8)
For this assignment, we will start from the finished version of the last Car assignment, and continue to build in more features.
* If, while driving, the car runs out of gas, print out `"The car ran out of gas after driving <distance> miles"`.
* If, while refueling, the user requests to add more gas than the tank maximum capacity, print `"The gas tank ran out of space, only <gasAmount> gallons of gas were added"`
* If the constructor receives a negative `mpg` or `gasTankCapacity` value, set them to the default (`mpg = 25`, `gasTankCapacity = 12`), and print out the message, `"<mpg or gasTankCapacity> cannot be negative, setting to default value <25 or 12>"`. (Print out the message twice if both were negative)
